Two methods to make script globally reachable:
1. Copy/move script into /usr/local/bin/ (or /bin) â†’ system-wide PATH.
   Example: sudo cp userdef /usr/local/bin/

2. Add its directory to PATH in ~/.bashrc or /etc/profile.
   Example: export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/script

Making it permanent:
- Add export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/script into ~/.bashrc or ~/.profile

Apply immediately without reopening terminal:
- Run: source ~/.bashrc
